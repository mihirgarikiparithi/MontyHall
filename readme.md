#Purpose

This simple Jupyter Notebook was written to determine the ideal strategy to use when approaching the famous Monty Hall thought experiment. 

#Approach

The program runs x simulations of the Monty Hall question, generating a probability to win.
The program then stores this probability in a list and repeats the whole process over and over up until y total runs. 

The winning probability spread is then graphed in a handful of ways and some basic analyses conducted on the generateed probability array.
